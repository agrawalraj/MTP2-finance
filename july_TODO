Paper todos:
--remove stars from tables
--include plots with lines (2 rows of 3 figures each)
--describe that T is varied as a ratio of N/T
--2.3.2 add sentence describing AFM-LS for shrinkage combining with eigenvalues (add in green)
--glasso comment that it is a biased estimator, but this is how it is used out of the box

Experimental TODOS:
--implement check function for all wrappers, make scripts out of notebooks to run
--get server set-up with new matlab/new storage to run all the scripts to re-generate all the tables
--KT table for MTP2, CLIME showing doesn't make too much difference for the choices of N, T
--re-generate the current tables in paper with glasso, CLIME, POET
--regenerate line plots with all the methods


Notes:
*******
POET estimator: 
    --using method to estimate optimal value of K takes 360 seconds
    (gives K=1) for pastRets[0,1]
    --without estimating K takes 18 seconds
    --using K=3 since underestimating K is bad, also can try K=5

CLIME estimator: 
    --using sqrt(log p / n) instead of cross-validation 
    (but seems reasonable on the 1 instance I tried it)
    --with cross validation with 10 lambda, 3 folds takes 100 seconds
    --with using particular value of lambda takes 3-6 seconds
