Paper todos:
--remove stars from tables
--include plots with lines (2 rows of 3 figures each)
--describe that T is varied as a ratio of N/T
--2.3.2 add sentence describing AFM-LS for shrinkage combining with eigenvalues (add in green)

Experimental TODOS:
--get server set-up with new matlab to run all the scripts to re-generate all the tables
--KT table for MTP2, CLIME showing doesn't make too much difference for the choices of N, T
--re-generate the current tables in paper with glasso, CLIME, POET
--regenerate line plots with all the methods

********

Notes for meeting

--the methods that we were thinking of adding were CLIME, LRPS, glasso and NLS
--of the above, CLIME is too slow, glasso does worse (so we include it), 
NLS and LRPS so far give really weird/bad results (possible using the package incorrectly)
--using KT does not really change too much (tried it with N=100, T=1260) for MTP2
we can have a table that shows negligible difference
----seems irrelevant to use for NLS, LRPS, glasso hard to use w/ cross-validation, used with MTP2,
weird to use with LS

glasso: 
NLS: leave out by now (email the dude maybe) -- some table with LS and NLS weird numbers, LRPS table 

--want to show that we have better sample complexity, which is clear

**end result: 2 tables like in the current paper, only add column for glasso
**and can have 1 extra table showing that KT doesn't matter too much: CLIME, MTP2 maybe POET

also the tables we have are non-standard, because they always have tables 
with all avg, sd, ir even though 1 of the columns are relevant. should we have those tables too?
(But this seems kind of secondary)


Implementation TODOs: 
    --POET with LS on residual (if that is necesary)
    --recreate infrastructure for making tables with new experiments
    
Computational TODOs: 
    --run CLIME, POET, glasso to create entries in the table
    --re-run entries in old table
    --KT table: run CLIME with KT and MTP2 with KT for selection N,T
    
Questions:
    --LRPS weird? 
    --LS & NLS weird?
    
POET estimator: 
    --using method to estimate optimal value of K takes 360 seconds
    (gives K=1) for pastRets[0,1]
    --without estimating K takes 18 seconds
    --using K=3 since underestimating K is bad, also can try K=5

CLIME estimator: 
    --using sqrt(log p / n) instead of cross-validation 
    (but seems reasonable on the 1 instance I tried it)
    --with cross validation with 10 lambda, 3 folds takes 100 seconds
    --with using particular value of lambda takes 3-6 seconds

TODO KT:
    POET with sample covariance matrix (?)
